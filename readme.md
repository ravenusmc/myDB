## Intro

This project is supposed to be a group project made with the help of other students at Gwinnett Technical College. I was tasked with starting to layout the front end of the project. However, I slowly started to build up more and more of the project and will see where it will lead. 

The project itself is supposed to allow a user to log in, create a table, be able to enter information into those tables and then see the data that they entered.

This project has been placed on hold for the time being.
